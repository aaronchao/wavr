/**
 * Deep-link OUT (Section 6): web URLs opened in a new tab. Stored URL when
 * known, else the app's web search for the show name so the icon still works.
 * A missing link with no fallback renders dimmed, never an error. PURE module.
 *
 * RSS-import note: the four consumer apps we link to (Apple, Spotify, YouTube
 * Music, 小宇宙) expose no *public web* add-by-RSS URL — their RSS import is a
 * native/mobile app-scheme flow, which can't open reliably from a web tab. So
 * when a show isn't on an app we fall back to that app's web *search* (the
 * closest working equivalent); the show's raw feed is always portable via the
 * Library's OPML export for apps that do support add-by-URL.
